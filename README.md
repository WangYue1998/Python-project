# Python-project
Total 12 projects.
The goal is that when students are presented with a problem they will say “I can write a program to solve that!”   
The theme is to take real data and analyze it.   
The course uses Python, and assumes no prior programming.  
Below is a sampling of the weekly programming projects from Fall 2017 (incorporating the list, set, and dictionary Python data structures).

# Project 6 (week 8)  
Using U.S. Geological Survey data (usgs.gov) students analyzed water usage of five types: public, domestic, industrial, irrigation, and livestock. Generating data such as this, as well as making a pie chart.  
# Project 7 (week 9)  
Daily we collected IP addresses from attacks on the CSE computer systems (using the most-significant numbers, a.k.a. Class C for privacy). We then asked the question: “What countries did the most attacks come from?” To answer that students had to merge information from three files: the attack IP addresses, a mapping of IP addresses to country codes, and
a mapping of country codes to full country names, e.g. UK for United Kingdom). They then sorted by attack counts and plotted the top ten.  
# Project 8 (week 10)  
Using data from the National Hurricane Center (nhc.noaa.gov) students extracted trajectories and maximum wind speed by hurricane and plotted them.
# Project 9 (week 11)   
Using Twitter data (twitter.com) of tweets using a selection of MSU related hashtags from MSU users, students wrote a program to address the following questions related to this data set:
• “What are the most common hashtags used by users collectively?”
• “What are the most common hashtags used by users as individuals?”
• “How does hashtag similarity between two users vary over time?”
