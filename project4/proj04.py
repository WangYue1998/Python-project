#  Computer Project #4
#  Implement FSM to recognize whether a given string conforms to the specific
#  pattern or not
#  3 functions in the skeleton :
#   (1)Prompts for a character and returns it if itâ€™s an empty string or a
#      single character. Prints an error message and re-prompts if the input
#      length is more than 1
#   (2)Take two parameters: current state and input character. Then find the
#      next state
#   (3)Calls the other two functions in a loop and keeps track of the entered
#      character and the state. Prints the results when the returned value of
#      get_char is empty string. And print whether it's laughing or not

    while len(ch)>1:
    # in case of invalid input, print the following error message
        print("Invalid input, please try again.")
        # continue asking input
        ch = input("Enter a character or press the Return key to finish: ")
    # return the ch at the end
